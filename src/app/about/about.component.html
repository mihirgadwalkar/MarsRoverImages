    <li> While most people know it as Curiosity, this Martian rover also goes by another, 
         more technical name: The Mars Science Laboratory.</li>
    <li>The Perseverance rover will seek signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for possible return to Earth</li>
    <li> Opportunity and Spirit showed that Mars had the wet and warm conditions in its ancient past that were potentially hospitable to life.</li>
    <li>scientists detected significant amounts of a silica mineral called tridymite. This detection was a surprise to the scientists,
      because tridymite is generally associated with silicic volcanism,
      which is known on Earth but was not thought to be important or even present on Mars.</li>

       This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it 
       more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists. 
       Each rover has its own set of photos stored in the database, which can be queried separately. There are several possible queries
       that can be made against the API. Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up
       from the rover's landing date. 
       <br>
       In This API  we provided a images of the mars planet which are sent by the different rovers and also provides
         details like sol,earth-date ,camera-details of each photo/image sent by respective rovers .

        <p class="card-text">Martian dust storms are common, but every decade or so, for reasons unknown, a monstrous one goes global,
           veiling the planet. The storms can be a mortal threat to exploration: The one in 2018 killed off NASA's 
           Opportunity rover by coating its solar panels in dust. Researchers say the storms may also be one of the culprits in 
           the ultimate martian cold case: how the once-wet planet lost its water.
